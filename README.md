PRM
===

PRM is an abstract role-playing video game with minimal visuals and mechanics. It is going to start
off as a shameless clone of one of my favorite Flash games of all time, NEKOGAMES'
[パラメータ](http://nekogames.jp/g2.html?gid=PRM) ("Parameters"), but will eventually take on a life
of its own. Probably.

The idea is that you're given a cryptic set of three-letter stats, some buttons to click, and you
have to figure out the rest yourself from there.

The game is barely partially functional at the moment, and it definitely not "playable."

Development of this game is mostly being done as an exercise to learn a new programming language
for video game development. ...And to have fun doing it, of course.
