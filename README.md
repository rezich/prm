PRM
===

PRM is an abstract role-playing video game with minimal visuals and mechanics. It is going to start
off as a shameless clone of one of my favorite Flash games of all time, NEKOGAMES'
[パラメータ](http://nekogames.jp/g2.html?gid=PRM) ("Parameters"), but will eventually take on a life
of its own. Probably.

The idea is that you're given a cryptic set of three-letter stats, and some buttons to click, and
you have to figure out the rest yourself from there.

The game is barely partially functional at the moment, and it definitely not "playable."
